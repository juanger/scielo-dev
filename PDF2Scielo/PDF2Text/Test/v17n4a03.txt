Se han elaborado los modelos autorregresivos integrados de media m&oacute;vil (ARIMA) para las series mensuales
de larga duraci&oacute;n, de temperaturas m&aacute;ximas y m&iacute;nimas, de los observatorios del suroeste espa&ntilde;ol. Se han
transformado las series originales para hacerlas estacionarias. Se han obtenido los &oacute;rdenes (p, d, q) para cada
serie mensual y, tras los procesos de validaci&oacute;n por medio de las series de residuos, tambi&eacute;n se han obtenido
los par&aacute;metros de las funciones estimadas de los modelos estoc&aacute;sticos mensuales. Como consecuencia, se
han formulado predicciones sobre su evoluci&oacute;n: las previsiones de los modelos ARIMA inducen a esperar
que la temperatura m&iacute;nima en la regi&oacute;n objeto de estudio se encuentra en una fase de incremento t&eacute;rmico
medio previsto del orden de 0.2 ºC en el pr&oacute;ximo decenio. Sin embargo, no est&aacute; definida significativamente la
evoluci&oacute;n de las temperaturas m&aacute;ximas. Estas estimaciones se corresponden con las obtenidas previamente
por los autores, en estudios anteriores, por otros m&eacute;todos, pero con mucha mayor precisi&oacute;n en este caso.
[abs] Abstract [/abs]
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models have been devised for long-term monthly
series of maximum and minimum temperatures from south-western Spanish observatories. The original series
were transformed into stationary ones, and the orders (p, d, q) for each monthly series were obtained. These
were validated using series of residuals, and the parameters of the functions were estimated from the monthly
stochastic models. The forecasts of change formulated from the ARIMA models suggest that the minimum
temperatures in the study area are in a mean warming phase of the order of 0.2 ºC over the next decade. The
change in maximum temperatures is not significantly defined. These estimations correspond with those
obtained by the authors in earlier studies using other methods, but the level of precision is much higher in this
case.

[sec] 1. Introduction [/sec]
The aim of stochastic analysis of time series by the formulation of ARIMA models is to separate
the observed elements into two components: The first contains the organized part, including the
trend, and the second the random residuals. The models constructed following such separation are
used in an attempt to explain the time structure of each series and predict its change. The time
series is considered a set of observables of the variables −maximum and minimum temperatures−
measured at regular intervals. In this study, temperature measurements made during the period of
observation are grouped to form monthly series.
Each of the series must be tested as fulfilling the statistical conditions required by the Box-
Jenkins method for such models. We then proceed to identify and estimate the corresponding
parameters, so that the estimated model not only fits the observations well, but also enables forecasts
to be made.
The theoretical basis of the proposed models, including the definition of conditions of applicability,
deduction of equations, and significance of the results, has been set out by various authors (Chatfield,
1992; Box and Jenkins, 1970; Kendall and Ord, 1990; Wei, 1990; Uriel, 1995; Pe&ntilde;a, 1995; Ferrand,
1997). Others have used autoregressive moving average techniques in sociology and economics,
and also, to a lesser degree, specifically in the study of meteorological variables (Garrido and
Garc&iacute;a, 1994; Al-awadhi and Jolliffe, 1998; Mart&iacute;n et al., 1998; Zekai, 1998, Bravo, et al., 2001;
Greiser et al., 2002; Solange and Pinto, 1996).
The following section indicates the observatories used in this study and the characteristics of
stationarity required for the time series. Section 3 briefly describes the methodological basis of
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) processes. Section 4 determines the order
for each series, the corresponding functions generated by the model, and the respective residual
series. Some of them have been represented graphically as an example. Section 5 estimates, from
the results obtained for each monthly series, the forecast for the following decade.
[sec] 2. Data [/sec]
The observatories selected for the study are those from south-west Spain (western Andaluc&iacute;a and
the south of Extremadura) having data series of the order of a century (Fig. 1). The records are
from Sevilla-Tablada (37º 22´N, 6º 00´W), C&oacute;rdoba (37º 53´N, 4º 47´W) Badajoz (38º 53´ N, 6º 58´
W), and Huelva (37º 15´, 6º 57´W). The series of variables analyzed are the monthly maximum and
monthly minimum temperatures from 1882 to 1999. (As the Huelva observatory ceased activity in
1983, no prediction has been made in section 5 due to the lack of data for the final period).
The data were previously subjected to a process of ‘‘gap-filling’’ and tested for uniformity
(Garc&iacute;a-Barr&oacute;n and Pita, 2001). We consider that these observatories characterize the south-western
Iberian Peninsula climate, a region of interest owing to the Azores anticyclone direct action on it.
Geo-graphically, the region is delimited by Lisbon and Gibraltar, continental points used by some
authors to demonstrate the effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation (Hurrell, 1995; Pita L&oacute;pez et
al. 1999; Pozo-V&aacute;zquez et al., 2000).
It is a prerequisite that the time series be stationary before application of the Box-Jenkins
method, so this must be verified and, if necessary, appropriate transformations made.
Accepting that the (Xt
) series fluctuate around the mean value m that characterizes them, we can
express the perturbations δ t
, as the differences between the observed values (xt
) and the µ value,
ct
= m + dt
.
The process is considered stationary if, for any of the subseries (Xjt
) into which the complete
time series is fragmented:
• the mean is constant −that is, the mathematical expectancy of the perturbation is zero.
• the variance is constant; in such case, the perturbation is denominated homocedastic.
• the perturbations are independent of each other −that is, the correlation rk
between two
observations, xt
and xt+k
, depends only on the number of lags separating them.
Furthermore, it is a requirement that the perturbations have a normal distribution, explicable by
the central limit theorem, such that they cannot be imputed to specific causes but result from the
effect of multiple random factors.
In the previous studies carried out (Garc&iacute;a-Barr&oacute;n, 2000), we obtained the following results:
• Regarding the stability of the mean, most of the monthly series show a trend in the minimum
temperatures (significant and with a slope coefficient between 1.7º and 3.3º per century,
depending on month and observatory) and also in the maximum temperatures (although not
constant in the sign of the slope, and with no statistical significance in some cases). It is
therefore recommendable that all the series undergo first-order differencing to eliminate this
trend (owing to the stability in variance a second derivation is not suggested).

• Regarding variance, the Levenne test shows that a great number of original series remain
within the limits of stability, with a quasi-normal distribution. Nevertheless, logarithmic
transformation generally improves variance, in particular in those series with homocedasticity
not initially accepted.
Thus, to unify the procedure, the adaptation criterion for all the series will be a first-order linear
derivation and logarithmic transformation. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirms that the
transformed monthly series fit the Gaussian distribution and can be accepted as meeting the
requirement of normality.
Save the exceptions indicated below, the monthly series of maximum and minimum temperatures
from the selected observatories fulfill the conditions required for stochastic analysis.
[sec] 3. Stochastic processes [/sec]
In the time domain, the series under study are considered as the specific result of a particular family
of variables representing a statistical phenomenon that changes over time. Such family of variables
is known as a stochastic process.
Any deductions from a single performance of the process require the imposition of restrictions:
To be stationary in mean and variance and ergodic. Moreover, the sample must have an approximated
normal distribution in order to satisfy the application rules in the autocorrelations of the later analysis.
Stochastic processes can be represented as linear combinations of terms in which random variables
take part, and, in particular, those formed by random pure processes (white noise), autoregressive
processes, and moving average processes.
An autoregressive process of order p, denominated AR(p), is that in which a term of the series
Xt
can be expressed as a linear combination of the preceding p terms plus one at random
Xt
= f1
Xt-1
+ f2
Xt-2
+ . . . + ft-p
Xt-p
+ et
so that, using the linear operator of lag L Xt
= Xt-1
gives
f (L) Xt
= et
.
A moving average process of order q, denominated MA(q), is that in which a term of the series
Xt
can be expressed as a linear combination of the preceding random q terms
Xt
= et
+ q1
et-1
+ q2
et-2
+ . . . + qq
et-q
.
An ARMA (p, q) process is autoregressive, of moving average, from the combination of the
former.

= f1

The reason for devising an ARIMA model is to find a function that, with a limited number of
parameters, is a sufficiently close representation of how the observed series behaves.
The key mechamism for identifying a stochastic process is the calculation of the autocorrelation
function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), that consider the values of the time
series in relation with its lags, thereby revealing its inner structure. The values of the mean m and
sampling covariances gk
establish the properties and relationships of the autocorrelation coefficients
rk
for the corresponding processes AR(p), MA(q), and ARMA(p, q).
The autocorrelation coefficient, rk,
, where k = 0, 1, . . . , indicates the lag interval between the
terms of the series. The sequence of rk
values constitutes the estimated autocorrelation function
(or correlogram) calculated from the values of the series. When rk
is used as estimator of the
stochastic processes, its distribution must be known in order to make inferences and to verify the
significance of the different coefficients.
The partial autocorrelation coefficient (PACF) of order k is defined as the measurement of the
linear relationship between k separate lags, independently of the intermediate values.
It is possible to demonstrate theoretically that in autoregressive AR(p) processes, a system of
equations is obtained relating the first p coefficients of autocorrelation with the parameters φ of the
process (Yule-Waker equations).In autoregressive processes, the autocorrelation function decreases
after a determined lag, geometrically or sinusoidally with possible alternation of sign, but without
becoming zero. This makes it difficult to interpret the correlogram for establishing the order: It is
necessary to use the function of partial autocorrelation coefficient. The Yule-Waker equations
enable the coefficients φi
to be determined. The partial autocorrelation coefficients will be different
from zero for lags not exceeding p, as by hypothesis the coefficients φ1
, φ2
, . . . ,φp
are non-zero.
In the moving average MA(q) processes, it is possible to obtain the relationship of the
autoregression coefficients with the θ parameters of the model. Autocorrelation coefficients rk
are
zero for lags above q, and the partial autocorrelation coefficients decrease exponentially and/or
sinusoidally.
Thus, the behavior of the autocorrelation function of a MA process seems to be similar to that of
the partial autocorrelation function of an AR process.
In the ARMA(p, q) processes, the identification of parameters is more complex because,
generally, in the ACF or in the PACF the first values do not behave constantly and the following
ones present damped oscillation, with no characteristic pattern. Although identifying mechanisms
have been proposed, the most used system is that of comparison with the theoretical behavior of
pre-established generative functions for values below p and q (Uriel, 1995).
The ARIMA (p, d, q) processes are ARMA (p, q) processes related to series that, not being
initially stationary, have been subjected to an order-d differencing process. That is, an ‘‘integrated’’
process is denominated ARIMA (p, d, q) if, taking differences of order d, is transformed into an
ARMA (p, q) −type stationary process.
Once the generative model is identified, the corresponding values of the parameters are calculated
from the known correlation coefficients.
Fit is verified by adaptation of the model, using analysis of residuals -the difference between
observed and obtained values. Ideal models are those of best fit with lowest number of parameters.
There are two methods of verification: by autocorrelation of residuals, or by residual variance.
Autocorrelation of residuals is based on their constituting white noise and random time distribution.
Consequently, subjected to correlational analysis, all the coefficients of the correlogram of residuals
must be within the confidence interval, being significantly zero. The alternative analysis of residual
variance establishes the best order of the autoregressive model to avoid overfit. This addresses the
significance of the extra variance explained by the introduction of a new parameter.
[sec] 4. Application to the series of temperatures. Results [/sec]
The presentation of the procedure and results follows the sequence of phases presented above.
4.1 Determination of order
We have stated that the order of the p autoregressive coefficients and of the q moving averages in
each series is determined using the autocorrelation coefficients (ACF) and partial autocorrelation
coefficients (PACF). Briefly, if the coefficients in the first q lags of the ACF are non-zero and the
following ones are zero, and those of the PACF decrease exponentially or sinusoidally, we initially
ascribe the series as MA(q). On the other hand, if the coefficients in the first p lags of the PACF
are non-zero and the following ones are zero, and those of the ACF decrease exponentially or
sinusoidally, we initially ascribe the series as AR(p). If the form of the ACF and PACF is a
superimposition of those described, the model is denominated ARMA(p, q).
To avoid reiteration in the graphical display of the procedure and observations, whose results
are implicit in the following tables, we will give later, as significant examples, only the monthly
series of September and March of the minimum temperatures from the Sevilla observatory (Figures
2, 3, 4, 5).
As the analysis is referred to monthly and annual series, which do not present stationarity, we
determine the orders of the ARIMA(p, d, q) models. Because the series present a trend, they are
subjected to first-order differencing so that, in such cases, d = 1.
The graphs (Figures 2-5) display the simple autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions
of the minimum temperatures for the months of September and March at Sevilla. The first conclusion
suggests both series belong to an MA(1) model, since only the first lag of the ACF is significantly
different from zero (although one of the later retards is very close to the level of confidence). The
shape of the first lags of theACF is descending. However, calculation of the corresponding coefficients
shows that the case of September leads to a state at the limit of invertibility (the theoretical condition
for rejecting the model). Thus, we reformulate the model as AR(3), since the three autoregressive
coefficients prove to be significant. Given that the series are subject to a trend, we introduce first-

order differencing and conditionally accept models of type (3,1,0) for September and (0,1,1) for
March. In both cases, logarithmic transformation is used to guarantee homocedasticity, so that the
residuals are expressed on that scale. (This does not affect the internal correlation.) With this
hypothesis, we construct the estimated series.
The models fulfilling the conditions (p, d, q) adequately represent the respective series of
observations. Nevertheless, this does not rule out the existence of another model with different
orders and a better fit. Before making predictions, it is useful to carry out an overfit such that
among different models (also subjected to the whole procedure described) the criterion of quality is
established by the lowest residual variance of the estimated series. (The residual variance is an
estimator obtained from the squared sum of the residuals divided by the degrees of freedom of the
series (n-2)).
Table 1 shows the orders (p, d, q) of the definitive models for each monthly series of maximum
and minimum temperatures at the selected observatories.
We can see that the series of minimum temperatures with one order of derivation and logarithmic
transformation fit pure models: 40% moving average −36% MA(1), although with only one case in
Huelva− and the remaining 60% autoregressive models, mostly AR(2) (24 %).
The orders of maximum temperatures fit principal models of moving average MA(1), with
Badajoz and Sevilla showing very similar values for the corresponding months. At C&oacute;rdoba,
autoregressive models predominate. For January at Sevilla, andApril and annually at Huelva, orders
of mixed autoregressive moving average AR(1) MA(1) models are produced, so that the first-
derivation treatment yields ARIMA(1, 1, 1).

We should point out that in repeated cases we have rejected MA(1) models due to their
autocorrelations, but in which the parameter q1
, probably well estimated, reaches values close to
unity (θ1
= 0.999 . . .), situating the model at the limit of invertibility. In these cases, we preferred
to look for the complementary autoregressive model, often of order 3 and above, even though
causing the residual variance to increase. (There is a dual relationship, so that theoretically an
MA(1) process is equivalent to anAR(∞) one with coefficients decreasing in geometric progression;
in practice, we looked for the complementary AR(n) that satisfies the general requirements.)
The values given in brackets [ ] in Table 1, indicate that their acceptance is subject to the
possible heterocedasticity of the series.
4.2 Identification of the model
The orders (p, d, q) established in the monthly series act as a basis for calculating the respective
parameters φp, θq of the equation of the model in each series.
The initial acceptance of these values requires that statistically they are significantly non-zero at
the level of confidence 0.95. With the coefficients accepted provisionally, the new series of values
estimated by the model is generated; this yields the residual series by difference between the series
of observed values and the respective estimated ones.
An autoregressive process of order p for the variable temperature {Tt
} is represented by the
equation
Tt = φ1 Tt-1 + . . . + φp Tt-p + εt + c
where f are the parameters whose acceptance has been previously validated. In the same way, a
moving average process of order q is represented as
Tt
= et
- q1
et-1
− . . . − qq
et-q
+ c
where {εt
} is a white noise process, with et
independent of the Tt-i
values, and c is a constant.
Identification of the ARIMA model that represents the organized component of each series,
besides being necessary before predictions can be made, is intrinsically valuable for establishing the
time organization of the set of observations and for characterizing the internal structure of each
series (Figures 6 and 7). The order of the parameters (p, d, q) of the model indicates the relationships
between consecutive elements of the meteorological variable, and knowing it enables comparative
classifications. As a mathematical model, autoregressive moving average functions constitute a
synthetic expression of the complex physical phenomenon which they represent in a simplified
way.
Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 include all the parameters calculated for the monthly and annual models for
the observatories of the study. They enable us to establish the corresponding series estimated from
the various models, and thereby obtain the residual series.
Each serial model (p, d, q) is validated from the non-correlation of its residual series. These
must be random −the white noise process− with zero mean, constant variance (conditions fulfilled
by the procedure applied if the series of observations is homocedastic), and non-correlated. For
this, we see from the graphs of the simple autocorrelation function that all the lags are in fact within
the interval of confidence. Thus, at the level of 0.95, the accepted residual correlation is significantly
zero (Figs. 8 and 9).

compatible with the structure of the data observed each month. The aim is to discover, within a
level of confidence and from the knowledge of a period of effective recording, the subsequent
behaviour of the series. The model devised is thus used in estimating the future values of the
variables under study. The equations of the model, fitted by the elements of the series for 1 ≤ t ≤
n, are used to progressively calculate the results of the variable t for n + 1, n + 2, . . . n + i.
We fixed the end of the prediction period as the year 2010 for procedural reasons and because
it coincides with proposals from other bodies. Increasing the prediction period means that it is

determined by the autoregressive elements, and the statistical limits of confidence are increased
such that they are no longer of any practical use. Groups of experts on climate change have chosen
this date for verifying control measures, and formulating different-angled hypotheses about change
in climate variables.It seems advisable to coincide with this period of analysis –rather long but
without loss of reliability in the estimations.
Evidently, the statistical model devised does not introduce external actions into the generative
mechanism, nor does it assume actions entering from outside the system itself. However, we have

to stress that the possible effects of anthropogenic activity, and its constant intensification, are
assimilated by the statistical model. Climate change has been progressively incorporated throughout
the period of recordings and has affected the meteorological variables under study in this research.
The formulated prediction implies that the actions on the climate system will continue in the near
future, similar in intensity and progression to those of the recent past.

C&oacute;rdoba until the year 2010, fromARIMAmodels, are included. We should point out that expression
of the annual predictions in hundredths of ºC is only of mathematical interest for observing variations
between years; from the point of view of climatic significance, the precision for temperature is of
tenths of a degree, as in the records of the series.
In order to compare the change obtained from preceding studies on the linear trend of the set of
historical series with the future predictions from the devised models, we calculated the seasonal
and annual values from the respective monthly estimations. Tables 9 and 10 present the trend of the
series of historical data and the future estimations.

of the residual series, of the fit of the devised
model for the series of maximum and
minimum temperatures in September at
Sevilla.
In the estimation of maximum temperatures, the warming in spring, common to all the
observatories −and very intense at Badajoz− is striking, when, historically, they have remained
stable. There is a marked divergence in thermal behavior predicted for the summers: A rise at
C&oacute;rdoba and fall at Sevilla, reflected in the annual warming at C&oacute;rdoba against the cooling at
Sevilla. The lack of statistical significance for the historical trend, and its inconstancy from one
observatory to another, perhaps lead to predictions that are not concordant.
The predictions for minimum temperatures at Badajoz are similar to those at Sevilla (perhaps as
a result of the relative similarity of the monthly orders of the respective p, d, q models). At C&oacute;rdoba,
the magnitude of the predicted decrease in winter minimum temperatures is surprising, and moderates
the annual general warming. In contrast, both Sevilla and Badajoz show an even greater intensification
of the rising trend for the near future, in accord with the results obtained by extrapolation of the
polynomial line of the historical series.

[sec] 6. Conclusions [/sec]
Autoregressive Integrated MovingAverage (ARIMA) models have been devised for the long-term
monthly series of maximum and minimum temperatures from observatories in south-west Spain.
Previously, it was confirmed that the first derivation and logarithmic transformation stabilized the
mean and variance of the original series, and converted them into stationary series.
The orders (p, d, q) for each monthly series have been obtained. The series of minimum
temperatures with one order of derivation and logarithmic transformation have been fitted to pure
moving average (MA) models (38%) –above all MA(1)– to autoregressive (AR) models (58%)
–mostlyAR(2)– and to some mixed (ARMA) models (4%).The maximum temperatures fit principal
moving average models MA(1), with very similar monthly values for Badajoz and Sevilla, whereas
at the C&oacute;rdoba observatory, the predominating models are autoregressive, AR (3).

The parameters θp
, φq
of the estimated functions of the monthly stochastic models have also
been obtained, and subjected to validation processes to test whether the corresponding series of
residuals are random. These values, and the residual variance, are given in the respective tables.
From the estimated functions for each month, predictions of change have been formulated:
Those from theARIMAmodels of minimum temperature suggest that the study region is in a phase
of annual mean thermal increase of the order of 0.2 °C in the next decade. However, the change in
maximum temperatures is not significantly defined. These estimations are in agreement with those
obtained in earlier studies using other methods, but because of the better goodness-of-fit, the level
of precision is much higher in this case.
