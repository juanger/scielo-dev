RESUMEN
Este trabajo analiza las características sinópticas de la circulación de los niveles altos y bajos de la troposfera
sobre América del Sur, durante la primera campaña para colecta de datos atmosféricos en mesoescala en la
época húmeda (Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign in the Wet Season - WETAMC) del Experimento de Gran
Escala en la Biosfera-Atmósfera de laAmazonia (LBA). Esta campaña fue realizada entre los meses de enero
y febrero de 1999 simultáneamente con la validación de los datos del satélite Tropical Rainfall Measuring
Mission (TRMM) sobre Brasil. Fueron utilizados datos puntuales reticulares de los National Centers for
Environmental Predictions (NCEP) para analizar los vientos y sus campos de divergencia asociados, a manera
de definir los patrones prevalecientes de la circulación troposférica en la región. Las imágenes TRMM fueron
utilizadas para delinear los patrones de lluvia. Los resultados muestran que ocurrieron por lo menos cuatro
patrones diferentes en los campos de viento en la alta troposfera, durante el período estudiado. Estos
patrones están asociados, principalmente, a la circulación anticiclónica de Bolivia y a los vórtices ciclónicos
en el noreste de Brasil. Los resultados también indican que, en general, la actividad convectiva sobre extensas
áreas de América del Sur es dinámicamente sustentada por divergencias a niveles altos. Dos de los seis
vórtices observados, presentaron desplazamientos anómalos en la Amazonia durante el período de estudio.
En los niveles bajos de la Zona de Convergencia delAtlántico Sur (ZCAS) no hubo actividad, a excepción de
la primera quincena de enero; adicionalmente, incursiones en dirección ecuatorial de sistemas frontales de
latitud media modularon la actividad convectiva en la región occidental de laAmazonia. Durante el período de
estudio, el flujo convergente de vapor de agua de nivel bajo derivado de los datos del NCEP presentó un
patrón parcialmente consistente con los campos de lluvia del TRMM.
ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes the synoptic scale features of the upper and lower level tropospheric circulation over
tropical SouthAmerica during the firstAtmospheric Mesoscale Campaign in the Wet Season (WETAMC) of
the Large Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment inAmazonia (LBA). This campaign occurred in January

and February, 1999 and concomitantly with the validation of theTropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)
satellite over Brazil. National Centers for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) grid point data were used to
analyze the winds and its associated divergence fields and define the prevailing patterns of the tropospheric
circulation in that region. TRMM images were used to depict the rain patterns. The results show at least four
distinct patterns in the upper air winds fields during the WETAMC-TRMM/LBA, involving mainly the
Bolivian anticyclonic circulation and cyclonic vortices in the vicinity of Northeast Brazil. The results also
suggest that, in general, the convective activity over vast areas of South America is dynamically supported
by upper level divergence. Two out of a total of six vortices were observed to have anomalous displacements
into the Amazonia during the study period. At lower levels, the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ),
except for the first half of January, was not active but equatorward incursions of midlatitude frontal systems
disturbed the convective activy in the Southwestern Amazon basin. Besides, during the period of the study,
the low-level moisture divergence as derived from NCEP data does not show convergence where the TRMM
rain field clearly reveals the existence of precipitation areas.
Key words: Cyclonic vortices, TRMM, SouthAtlantic convergence zone, Bolivian High
1. Introduction
The first Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign in the Wet Season (WETAMC) of the Large Scale
Biosphere  Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) (Silva Dias et al., 2002) occurred in
Rondonia, Brazil during the southern summer, from January to February, 1999. This season was
chosen because typically it is characterized by a pronounced tropospheric circulation variability
with great impact on the regional rainfall regimen. Rutledge et al. (2000) noticed that during the
WETAMC, the development of the mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) occurred under two
distinct meteorological regimens: monsoon and break. In the former case, low level westerly/
northwesterly winds prevailed with humidity relatively large and abundant precipitation; in the latter,
the convective activity was under low-level easterly flow, with a much drier troposphere. In addition,
Cifelli et al. (2002), suggest that the distinct wind regimens (easterly and westerly) observed in
Rondonia during the WETAMC control the local rainfall and are associated with the displacements
of frontal systems in Southeastern Brazil.
Several studies have shown that many of the large scale characteristics of the circulation over
South America can be simulated using three dimensional and time varying tropical heat sources
(Silva Dias et al., 1983; Gandu and Gesiler, 1991) as well as with a forcing due to the extratropical
convection (Belassiano, 2000). Gandu and Silva Dias (1998) showed that during the austral summer
both the convective activity over the western and central Pacific as well as over Africa have an
impact on the high level tropospheric circulation and the subsidence patterns in the middle troposphere
over South America and adjacent oceans. Thus, from the synoptic point of view, the tropospheric
circulationovertropicalSouthAmericaandneighboringareasismoreeasilyunderstoodbyconsidering
the dynamics of the upper and lower troposphere separately. In this context the main features of
the upper level circulation in this region are the interhemispheric bifurcation of the flow over the
Eastern Pacific, the anticyclonic circulation known as the Bolivian High (BH) (Virji, 1981), the
15Tropospheric circulation over SouthAmerica during the WETAMC/LBAexperiment
upper level cyclonic vortices in the vicinity of Northeast Brazil (CVNE) (Kousky and Gan, 1981;
Mishra et al., 2001), the troughs originated from the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes (TRs), the
tropical troughs over the Northern and Southern Pacific Ocean and the troughs over the Northern
Atlantic Ocean (Ramírez et al., 1999). On the other hand, at lower levels the outstanding features
include the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) (Kodama, 1992; Carvalho et al., 2002), the
convective activity over the Amazonia (Greco et al., 1990) and the stable semi-arid climate of
Northeast Brazil (Rao and Hada, 1999).
During the WETAMC-TRMM/LBAexperiment the main scientific interest was on the mesoscale
features of the regional circulation. As a consequence, there was a significant effort addressed to
understanding the local interactions involving the biosphere/atmosphere, cloud dynamics and
microphysics, TRMM-satellite precipitation radar and micrometeorology (e.g., Cifelli et al., 2002;
Petersen and Rutledge, 2001). However, it was deemed that a diagnostic study of the most important
synoptic scale features of the atmospheric circulation during theWETAMC-TRMM/LBAexperiment
would certainly be useful to acquire a better understanding of the acting mesoscale processes.
Thus this work is concerned with the dominant synoptic aspects of the atmospheric circulation over
tropical South America during that time period. Emphasis was given on the diagnosis of the upper
and lower tropospheric winds and the analysis of the TRMM-derived rainfall fields.
2. Data and methodology
The variables used in this study were the daily air temperature (T), zonal (u) and meridional (v)
wind components and specific humidity (q) obtained from the global model reanalysis project NCEP/
NCAR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center forAtmospheric Research)
(Kalnay et al., 1996). They have a 2.5o
× 2.5o
lat  lon resolution and are given at 1000-, 925-, 850-,
700-, 500-, 250-, 200- and 100-hPa isobaric levels. The spatial domain extends from 15o
N to 4o
S
and 95o
W to 15o
W and the studied period includes the months of January and February, for which
monthly means (using data from 1978 to 1999) and daily analyses during the WETAMCTRMM/
LBA period were analyzed. The moisture flux and wind divergence were also examined. The first

The software GrADS  GridAnalysis and Display System (Doty, 1997) was used for processing
and graphical visualization of the results. A script was also used to plot CVNE trajectories reading
the daily lat-lon vortex center coordinates from an ASCII file with the GrADS read scripting
command, and appropriate commands to analyze and plot the data over a map background.

The analyses of rainfall fields over South America were based on gridded daily rainfall data
obtained using the 3B42-TRMM- Adjusted Merged-Infrared Precipitation algorithm which
calibrates VIRS (Visible and Infrared Sounder) infrared measurements with precipitation estimates
given by TMI (TRMM Microwave Imager). The calibration parameters were then used to obtain
adailycompositionofIRdatafromtheavailablemeteorologicalgeostationarysatellites.Thealgorithm
yields estimates of precipitation near the surface with a 1o

lat - lon resolution, within the
tropical belt between 40o
N and 40o
S. Details of this methodology are described in Huffman et al.
(1995) and in the User´s Guide, made available by the TRMM Data and Information System
(TSDIS) at http://tsdis.gsfc.nasa.gov. The 3B42 data were obtained from NASA (National
Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration) via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), at the following address:
http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/.
3. Results
Next a brief description of the climatological characteristics of the upper and lower levels tropospheric
circulation over tropical SouthAmerica during the first two months of the austral summer is presented.
The dominant features are compared with those of January/February 1999, the period during which
the WETAMC  TRMM / LBA experiment was carried out.
3.1. Upper level features
The upper level circulation in tropical South America in January (Fig. 1a) is governed by BH and
CVNE. Strong divergent areas are observed in the Southeastern Atlantic Ocean, associated with
the SACZ and along the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The most pronounced areas of
divergence over Brazil are induced by the BH/CVNE circulation system. Since the convective
activity in these areas is strong (not shown), the divergence may be responsible for the organization
of the rainfall inAmazonia and Central and Southeastern Brazil. Therefore, eventual displacements
of the BH/CVNE system would imply shifts of the convective activity. Furthermore, the observed
differences in the divergence fields over the continent and Southwestern Atlantic Ocean suggest
that the SACZ dynamics may be modulated by distinct processes over these regions. On the other
hand, during January 1999 (Fig. 1b), the 250 hPa flow in tropical SouthAmerica showed a slightly
different pattern. Instead of the typical anticyclonic circulation center and the associated downstream
trough, one observes a pair of anticyclones and the CVNE. The anticyclonic circulation over western
Bolivia is the BH and the other downstream anticyclonic circulation (AT) appears when BH extends
eastward. Ramírez et al. (1999) suggest that this type of situation favors the inland displacement of
CVNE and is associated with the presence of the SACZ or the passage of troughs in Southeastern
Brazil. It becomes evident from the comparison between the climatological pattern and the January
1999 conditions (Fig. 1b) that most of the tropospheric circulation in South and Southeastern Brazil
was under the influence of theAT, thus with anomalous characteristics.Aclosed circulation, instead
of a trough, was the dominant feature over the Tropical Atlantic Ocean near NE, due to the high
frequency of occurrence of vortices in that region.
17Tropospheric circulation over SouthAmerica during the WETAMC/LBAexperiment
Except for a zone of weaker divergence along the SACZ, the mean upper tropospheric circulation
in February, 1999 (Fig. 2a) is quite similar to that of the preceding month. On the other hand, during
the WETAMC  TRMM/LBA (Fig. 2b) one can notice that the BH had shifted slightly southward
and the trough near NE, not yet clearly defined, had a smaller meridional amplitude with a
southeastward orientation. The observed divergence field suggests weak convective activity along
the SACZ, but not along the ITCZ over the tropical Western Atlantic Ocean.

3.2. Lower level features
The mean 850 hPa circulation over tropical SouthAmerica during the austral summer is dominated
by the trade winds at low latitudes and the subtropical South Atlantic Ocean High (SAH). Under
this circumstance, the trade winds have an important role in advecting moisture from the tropical
Atlantic Ocean into NE andAmazonia (Rao and Marques, 1984).This moisture feeds the convective
activity over land. On the other hand, the northeasterly winds in the occidental sector of the SAH
are important for establishing and maintaining the SACZ´s oceanic branch.
The mean 850 hPa water vapor flux divergence fields during January and February (Figs. 3a,
4a) show high values along the northern/northeastern coast of Brazil. Moisture convergence is also
observed along portions of the SACZ, the slopes of theAndes in Southwestern Bolivia (topographic
effect), western NE and over the Brazilian Amazonia. The main observed feature of the lower
level circulation during WETAMC  TRMM/LBA (Figs. 3b, 4b) is the vast region of moisture
convergence in the Amazonia and along the SACZ, although other centers were also observed to
the west of NE and Central Amazonia. The 850 hPa moisture flux convergence was slightly
pronounced, extending from the southern part of theAmazonia to the Southeastern Atlantic Ocean
(due to the passage of frontal systems), despite the absence of SACZ events in February 1999.

The moisture flux convergence patterns over Amazonia and Southeastern and Northern Brazil
during January and February 1999 are partly consistent with the rainfall field retrieved from TRMM
data (Figs. 5a-b). For several areas (e.g. the eastern slopes of the Andes Mountains near
Southwestern Bolivia, ITCZ, the north/northeast Brazilian coast, western portions of NE Brazil and
the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean) NCEP data do not show convergence where the satellites
19Tropospheric circulation over SouthAmerica during the WETAMC/LBAexperiment
indicates the existence of precipitating areas. It is likely that this disagreement may be associated
with the models space resolution, parametrization schemes and the representativeness of the
assimilated data. It should be pointed out that the conventional meteorological network over tropical
South America is quite sparse.

reveals that: a) the SACZ was present only during the period of the 6th
-18th
of January when the
rainfall was heavier (about 60 mm) between 44o
W and 48o
W, over São Paulo state and b) SACZ
episodes were not observed in February although there were two situations of heavy rainfall due to
the penetration of frontal systems (Feb. 18 and Feb. 26), along the coast of São Paulo state. In all
these events, frontal displacements in Southeastern Brazil prompted rainfall in Rondonia and Southern
Amazonia, in agreement with the findings of Rickenback et al. (2001), and Cifelli et al. (2001).As
they suggested the large scale modulates the convective activity in Rondonia, so that low-level
westerly (easterly) winds tend to yield larger (smaller) areas of weak (strong) precipitation.
3.3 Upper level circulation patterns during the WETAMCTRMM/LBA
The upper level circulation during the WETAMCTRMM/LBAwas characterized by BH, CVNE,
troughs and an anticyclonic system (AT) located between Southeastern Brazil and adjacent oceanic
areas. The BH position was observed to be quite variable, oscillating between 90o
W and 55o
W.
This displacement was associated with CVNEs moving inland, the formation ofATand equatorward
incursion of middle latitude troughs (TRs). Six major events of CVNEs (Fig.7) were observed
during the studied period, with a mean life time of approximately 6.9 days and most of them showing
a vertical extension between 200 and 400 hPa.
The first vortex (V1) appeared on January 2nd
, 1999 at approximately 12o
S and 30o
W, over the
NE eastern coast and gradually shifted toward theAmazonia where by January 13th
it had dissipated.
During this movement, its associated subsidence and sensible heat flux were responsible for an
evident suppression of the convective activity over theAmazonia. Concomitantly, the BH had also

zonia (5°

W), during January 1st
to February 28th

21Tropospheric circulation over SouthAmerica during the WETAMC/LBAexperiment
shifted westward reaching the Southeastern Pacific Ocean (Southwestern Perú). The displacement
of V1 into Amazonia may indeed be regarded as an anomalous situation, for just a few percent of
the vortices originating in the NE region move inland (Ramírez et al., 1999).
The second vortex (V2) had a shorter life time (3 days); it originated between the coast of Rio
Grande do Norte state and the Equator, on January 14th
, 1999. It also moved westward reaching
Northeastern Pará state where it dissipated on the 17th
. The origin of V2 was associated with a
southwestern amplification of a ridge, in its turn, to an anticyclonic circulation over Northwestern
Africa. The genesis of vortices over the NE, linked to this kind of circulation was studied by Paixão
and Gandu (2000). During the active stage of V2, the BH was found in the southwest of Perú, over
the Pacific Ocean, and connected to the anticyclonic circulation of the SouthwesternAtlantic Ocean.
The atmospheric circulation pattern during this period affected the convective activity over tropical
Brazil.

The third vortex (V3), contrasting to the usual genesis, originated over the continent, 13o
S,
49.5o
W (north of Goiás state) on January 20th
, 1999 and shifted eastward reaching the Sergipe
state (eastern coast of NE) by January 25th
, 1999 where it dissipated. During this period, the BH
moved eastward, toward Bolivia and theAT position was over the Southern Paraná state (Southern
Brazil).
The fourth vortex (V4) originated over the eastern coast of NE, approximately 12o
S on January
29th
, 1999. This vortex had a westward displacement, reaching the northern part of Rondonia state,
where it dissipated. At the same time the BH was between Southern Paraguay and Northern
Argentina, thus further south of its climatogical position. This is a situation that potentially could
decrease rainfall along the trajectory of the vortex center.
The fifth vortex (V5) originated over the Atlantic Ocean (18o
S, 20o
W ) on February 1st
, 1999.
This vortex also moved westward and dissipated seven days later over the Southern Piaui state
(northern NE). The BH was located during this event over Northern Argentina, further south than
its climatological position. Finally, the sixth vortex (V6) appeared at the eastern side of Southern
Bahia state on February 13th
, 1999, due to the expansion of a trough to the east of the BH. This
vortex had a westward displacement, dissipating over the northern part of Minas Gerais state
(Southeastern Brazil) nine days later.
An analysis of the prevailing upper circulation patterns over tropical South America during the
WETAMCTRMM/LBA period is presented next. The observed four main patterns are quite
distinct, regarding the relative positons of the BH and CVNEs.
3.3.1 BH/CVNE circulation pattern
The BH/CVNE circulation pattern dominated the first days of the first, fourth and sixth events of
CVNE. Under this kind of situation, the vortex geneses is due to the amplification of an upper level
ridge associated with equatorward-moving cold fronts over SouthAmerica (Kousky and Gan, 1981).
The BH is well defined and is situated over the Southwestern Amazonia near Bolivia, and the
CVNEs are found over the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 8). By the beginning of January
1999, the rainfall associated to the BH/CVNE circulation extended from the SouthernAmazonia to
the SouthwesternAtlantic Ocean due to a cold front in the region. The highest daily rainfall values
(30 to 40 mm) occurred in Southeastern Brazil where the cold front advanced into the states of
Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro (Fig. 9). Fair weather was observed in the NE when the CVNE
was still located over the ocean. As mentioned before, the rainfall at this time of the year seems to
be associated with the presence of upper level divergence in the transition region between the two
opposite circulation systems: the BH and the CVNE. Therefore, eventual oscillations of the BH/
CVNE system (not shown) are accompanied by northeastward/southeastward displacements of
frontal systems in Southeastern and Southern Brazil.
3.3.2 BH /CVNE/AT circulation pattern
This type of pattern, identified by Ramírez et al. (1999), is more evident when the CVNE is in its
23Tropospheric circulation over SouthAmerica during the WETAMC/LBAexperiment
Fig.8. 250 hPa streamlines for January 2nd

intensification stage and during its displacement inland. In this situation the BH generally acquires
a northwest/southeast orientation as the CVNE initiates its movement. The BH elongates over
Southeastern Brazil as the CVNE moves inland (Fig. 10). Depending on the intensification of the
ridge, the BH may split into two parts, with the eastern flank forming a new anticyclonic center
(AT) over Southeastern Brazil and adjacent oceanic areas.
The amplification of the ridge along the southeastern side of the BH for the V1 event mentioned,
occurred with the arrival of a frontal system from Argentina, which remained stationary for five
days (Jan. 610) and established the SACZ. As a consequence, warmer air advection in the lower
levels contributed to the intensification of the upper level ridge, creating favorable conditions for
enhancing the convection in Northern São Paulo state and WesternAmazonia (Fig. 11). During this
period, the ridge amplification favored the formation of an AT to the south of the CVNE, thus
establishing the circulation pattern involving the BH (with a westward shift toward the Southern
Pacific Ocean), the CVNE (moving into the continent) and theAT.Although the SACZ is a dominant
feature in the lower levels of the summer circulation over Brazil, only one SACZ episode was
observed during the JanuaryFebruary 1999 period.
Related to the BH/CVNE/AT pattern, it was observed that despite the existence of a vortex, a
new one may form to the northeast of the AT, as exemplified by V2, V4 and V6. Ramírez et al.
(1999) performed a climatological study on the formation mechanisms of tropical vortices and
Fig.10. 250 hPa streamlines for January 7th
, 1999, associated to the BH/CVNE/AT circulation pattern.
25Tropospheric circulation over SouthAmerica during the WETAMC/LBAexperiment
concluded that 27 % of the CVNEs are associated with the occurrence of ATs. During this type of
situation, the release of latent heat from stationary frontal systems or the SACZ would maintain the
AT and the associated upper level region of divergence.
Whenever there is an intensification of the southeastern sector of the BH over Southeastern
Brazil and adjacent oceanic areas, the spatial rainfall pattern resembles a convective cloud band
with an NWSE orientation to the west of the ridge and a mid-latitude trough in the upper levels
(Fig. 9). This rainfall band is generally associated with a frontal system. Once the cloudiness of the
western and northern sectors of the CVNE reaches the NE coast, it interacts with the convective
activity associated with the BH and frontal systems, frequently forming a Y pattern of cloudiness
(Ferreira et al., 2001). The Y pattern follows the CVNE during its inland displacement.
3.3.3 BH/AT circulation pattern
The establishment of the BH/AT pattern, which lasts a few days, is generally observed after the
dissipation of a CVNE over the central continent. The observed circulation between Jan. 1819
(Fig. 12) is a good example of this type of situation, when the BH moves westward off the Peruvian
coast and the AT is found over the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean near Southeastern Brazil. In
addition, a trough forms between the two anticyclonic circulations over Argentina, favoring the
convection in Southeastern Paraguay. In this case, the prevailing rainfall pattern consists of a
convective band to the southwest of the AT and stratiform rainfall over vast areas in the Amazonia
(Fig. 13).

3.3.4 BH/TR circulation pattern
Two episodes involving BH and TR were observed during the WETAMC-TRMM/LBA experiment.
The first one occurred between Feb. 11  12 when the BH showed an almost symmetric configuration
extending zonally as far as Goiás state (central Brazil), with its core centered near Northern Chile
(Fig.14). A pronounced mid-latitude trough stretching from Northern São Paulo state to the
Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (see marked line, Fig 14), was associated to a band of moderate
rainfall produced by a frontal system (Fig. 15). Under this situation, the CVNE is not present and
the frontal system is free to move northeastward. Similarly, during the second episode (Feb. 23 
28) the BH was over Northern Chile, favoring the penetration of two mid-latitude troughs in Southern
Brazil (not shown).As mentioned earlier, this pattern synchronizes the displacements of the rainfall
band northeastward in Southeastern Brazil and southwestward inAmazonia. In other words, by the
time it reaches Southeastern Brazil, the frontal system interacts with the convection in Amazonia,
organizing and making it shift northeastward. This feature also favors the formation of troughs with
a NW/SE inclination over theAtlantic Ocean, near the eastern coast of the NE and the formation
of AT in central Western Brazil.
4. Concluding remarks
This study analyzes the synoptic scale features of the upper and lower levels tropical circulation

over South America during the first Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign in the Wet Season
(WETAMC) of the Large Scale Biosphere  Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA). The
analyses were carried out using the National Centers for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) data
and rainfall fields derived from TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) data. During the
studied period (January and February 1999) the tropospheric circulation in the region showed distinct
features from the climatological pattern. At least four distinct flow patterns were identified in the
upper troposphere, mainly related to the Bolivian High (BH) and cyclonic vortices in the vicinity of
Northeast Brazil (CVNEs). In two observed events, CVNEs moved from the NE coast intoAmazonia
and their associated subsidence and changes in the circulation pattern may have impaired the
precipitation in some parts ofAmazonia.
It was also observed that from the synoptic point of view the instability in the region is dynamically
supported by upper level divergence in the transition zone of the Bolivian anticyclone (BH) and the
cyclonic circulation in the vicinity of NE Brazil (CVNE) in the upper troposphere. Kousky and Gan
(1981) suggested that the convective activity associated with CVNEs depends on thermal direct
circulation, the position of the vortex and the direction of their movement. In the present study, it is
suggested that the convective activity depend on the interaction between the BH/CVNE circulations
and not only on CVNE dynamics. At lower levels moisture convergence derived from NCEP data
coincides only partially with the rain areas detected by TRMM satellites.Also, significant interaction
involving frontal systems and convective activity in SouthwesternAmazonia was evident.
